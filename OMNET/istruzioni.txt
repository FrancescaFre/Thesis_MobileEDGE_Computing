----------------- INET

3. Open the OMNeT++ IDE and choose the workspace where you have extracted the inet directory.
   The extracted directory must be a subdirectory of the workspace dir.

4. Import the project using: File | Import | General | Existing projects into Workspace.
   Then select the workspace dir as the root directory, and be sure NOT to check the
   "Copy projects into workspace" box. Click Finish.

5. Open the project (if already not open) and wait until the indexer finishes.
   Now you can build the project by pressing CTRL-B (Project | Build all)

6. To run an example from the IDE open the example's directory in the Project Explorer view,
   find the corresponding omnetpp.ini file. Right click on it and select Run As / Simulation.
   This should create a Launch Configuration for this example.

If the build was successful, you may try running the demo simulations.
Change into examples/ and type "./rundemo".
